\chapter{Acknowledgements}
	I would like to thank my advisor Prof. Dr. Marcel Waldvogel, for his guidance and constructive discussions throughout my research. It helped me understand the principles of Distributed systems and how those principles apply to Blockchains. I am thankful to my supervisor Robert MÃ¼ller who always found my ideas interesting and helped me limit my thesis scope.
	
	I am grateful to all my friends who helped me understand Blockchain from the perspectives of Economics, Philosophy, Psychology, and Mathematics. I am also grateful to authors like Yuval Noah Harari for `Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind' and Raoul Martinez for `Creating Freedom: Power, Control and the Fight for Our Future,' which helped me understand Human Evolution and Human Behavior.  Without this holistic understanding, this thesis wouldn't have been possible.
	
	I would also like to thank Jun.-Prof. Dr. Stephan Streuber for giving me the opportunity to work on Virtual Reality projects involving collective behavior while working on my thesis. This helped me explore my other interests in Computer Science.
