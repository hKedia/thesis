# M.Sc. Thesis

#### Working Title

Secure Smart Contracts & Scalable Decentralized Applications (dApps)

#### Task Description

1. Blockchain is slow and interently non-scalable. Explore different layer-2 solutions which enable scalable applications while ensuring security.
2. Smart Contracts on Ethereum are vulnerable to hacks due to design flaws in the Solidity language. Explore different metrics which make a Smart Contract system secure and compare Ethereum to other Smart Contract enabled blockchains.

#### Analysis & Comparison

- Analyse layer-2 solutions such as side chains, parallel chains and virtual chains.
- Analyse the metrics for a secure smart contract platform.
- A through camparison between Ethereum and other smart contract blockchain.

#### Development

Implementation of the decentralized file sharing applications using one of the layer-2 solutions.

#### Desired Outcome

- A set of metrics for a secure smart contract platform.
- Comparison results between Ethereum and another public blockchain.
- An appication for secure data exchange which is scalable and inexpensive to use.
