Information requires data and an economy requires a unit of account. It's important that in the \textit{Information Economy} enabled by the internet, we own our data. Blockchain with its native token enables a unit of account. It also serves as the base layer for building a Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) enabling every individual to have a Self-Sovereign Identity. The concept of users owning their digital identity enables decentralized applications with Data Ownership.

This thesis explores the different concepts which make up a web application and describes how each can be decentralized using Blockchain and other peer-to-peer protocols. We analyze the state-of-the-art in decentralized applications platforms by building two \textit{proof-of-concept} applications for file sharing, one built on Ethereum and second built on Blockstack.

The main aim of the thesis is to provide its readers with a better understanding of what Blockchain technology enables and showcase certain properties of a secure decentralized applications platform.
