#### Analysis & Comparison

- Explore different concepts of a web application and compare the traditional way of building applications with the new decentralize way enabled by the Blockchain.

#### Development

- Implementation of the decentralized file sharing applications one using Ethereum and another using Blockstack to demonstrate the state of the art.

#### Desired Outcome

- Defines different concepts of an application and shows how to build applications where user owns their data.
- Two Proof of Concept applications to show the workings of these protocols with secure file share as an example.
